# Algorand NFT SDK

Welcome to the Algorand NFT SDK! The Algorand NFT SDK is software to help you to manage and interact with Algorand Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in the Algorand network. The project comes in 2 flavours, one is more for developers and the other one for non-developers. The first flavour is a Python package that you can use for managing the NFTs by coding and use it for your own applications. The second flavour is a command line interface (CLI).

## Motivation

The main motivation of this project is to provide great tooling to help developers and non-developers to manage their NFTs in the Algorand network by minimizing the learning curve. And of course, to have fun while building for others and learning about a great project, Algorand.
